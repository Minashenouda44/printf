Custom _printf Function

Introduction

This custom _printf function is a C programming utility that allows users to format and print data to the standard output.
It is inspired by the standard C printf function but has a limited set of format specifiers and does not handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers.


Usage

To use the _printf function, include it in your C code and call it with the desired format specifier and arguments.

The function supports the following format specifiers:

%c: Print a character.
%s: Print a string.
%%: Print a percent sign.
%d or %i: Print an integer.
%b: Print an integer in binary.
%u: Print an unsigned integer.
%o: Print an unsigned integer in octal.
%x: Print an unsigned integer in lowercase hexadecimal.
%X: Print an unsigned integer in uppercase hexadecimal.
%p: Print a pointer address.
%r: Print a reversed string.
%R: Print a string in reverse order.


Limitations

This custom _printf function does not support flag characters.
It does not handle field width or precision.
Length modifiers (e.g., h, l, ll) are not supported.

This function is still under development, and some features may not work properly.
